\usage{
spi_normalisation_m(type, normdata = NULL, rawdata = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{Variable that accepts the following values:
\itemize{
\item "regional" to normalise values for the NUTS-2 EU regions;
\item "national" to normalise values for the EU state members.
}}

\item{normdata}{Normalisation data needed according to the EU-SPI (2020) methodology.
By default, (normdata = NULL) it uses the official normalisation data provided by
the European Commission. See details to learn how to use custom normalisation data.}

\item{rawdata}{Data frame of values that need to be normalised. By default, (rawdata = NULL)
it uses the official raw indicator data provided by the European Commission.}
}

\details{
\subsection{Custom Normalisation Data}{

The custom normalisation data needs to be a data frame containing 4 columns, as such:
\itemize{
\item First column: (character) Should have the indicator name, one for each row.
\item Second column: (logical) Should represent whether that indicator is inverted
(negative relation to the index) or not (positive relation to the index).
\item Third column: (numeric) Should have the utopian values for each indicator.
\item Fourth column: (numeric) Should have the dystopian values for each indicator.
}
}

\subsection{Custom Raw Data}{

The function expects the raw data to have one indicator per column, with the values
all being numeric. At the start of the data frame, some character columns can be had
like the NUTS Codes or the Region Names, and they will be kept to the normalised data
frame.
